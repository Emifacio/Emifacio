<h3>Basics about me. :cowboy_hat_face:</h3>
<hr>

<p>Collaboration and Proactivity
I stand out for my ability to collaborate and complement the team's work proactively. My responses are quick and precise, thanks to my advanced information management mechanisms, known as my "second brain" or "digital brain."

Passion for Software Development
I am a passionate software developer with experience in designing, coding, installing, testing, packaging, and maintaining systems. Every day, I choose to take the next step toward improving and growing professionally as a bilingual programmer.

Learning and Adaptability
I have repeatedly demonstrated my ability to learn new skills and knowledge in record time. I stay informed and test new technologies and tools to offer higher quality products in less time.

Under pressure performance
I excel in maintaining intense concentration and unwavering commitment, even under pressure, consistently delivering high-quality results with speed and precision. My strong dedication to meeting deadlines is paired with a goal-oriented mindset, and I possess laser-sharp focus in demanding situations. 

Innovative Thinking
I think in a circular manner and use methods to find disruptive and innovative solutions, always oriented towards positive results. These solutions are aligned with the principles that unite us as a group, and I strive to build positive relationships that contribute to organizational success.
